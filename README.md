# XML Handler Prototype
A "fully functional" handler written in Java that can read, add, and delete content to the necessary files for the group project. This is a Java project written in Eclipse, as such, it is recommended to use Eclipse when you clone this.

IMPORTANT NOTE: the XML files **MUST BE IN THE RESOURCES FOLDER**. Also, I think this is by default when you clone this, but it has to be marked as a source folder in Eclipse. If you run into problems, just right click the resources folder and set it as a source path or something like that.
